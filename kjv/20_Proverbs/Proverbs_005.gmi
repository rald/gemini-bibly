Proverbs 5:9 -> Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:

Proverbs 5:10 -> Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger;

Proverbs 5:11 -> And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,

Proverbs 5:12 -> And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;

Proverbs 5:13 -> And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
