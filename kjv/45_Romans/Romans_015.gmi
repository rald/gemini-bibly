Romans 15:3 -> For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.

Romans 15:4 -> For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.

Romans 15:5 -> Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:

Romans 15:6 -> That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Romans 15:7 -> Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.

Romans 15:8 -> Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:

Romans 15:16 -> That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.

Romans 15:21 -> But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.

Romans 15:31 -> That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;

Romans 15:32 -> That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.

Romans 15:33 -> Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
